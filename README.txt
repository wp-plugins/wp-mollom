=== Mollom (old) ===
Contributors: Matthias Vandermaesen
Requires at least: 2.5.0
Tested up to: 2.9.0
Stable tag: 0.7.5

Superseded by new Mollom plugin.

== Description ==

Superseded by new and vastly improved [Mollom plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/mollom/).

= How to upgrade =

1. Deactivate and uninstall/delete the old `wp-mollom` plugin (version 0.7.5 or older).
1. Install the new [Mollom plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/mollom/) (version 2.0 or later).
1. Re-enter your Mollom API keys.

There is no automated upgrade path, since the plugin has been entirely rewritten, and re-installing the new is a matter of minutes.  Also, this old plugin was used by a few users only.  
We're sorry for this (one-time) inconvenience.


== Installation ==

Do not install this plugin; **use the new [Mollom plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/mollom/) instead**.
